Playing Timing</strong></p><p>As mentioned earlier, Stumble Guys stages have different obstacles.

Use Emotes sparingly</strong></p><p>For those who are curious about what an emote is, the emote in Stumble Guys is a feature where we can stop the opponent's movement.</p><p>Emotes can certainly be very helpful. But in the wrong conditions, emotes can actually make us lose.</p><p>Therefore, it is recommended to use the emote only as necessary. And make sure the emote timing is right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Learn Each Stage</strong></p><p>With different stages, the completion of each stage must also be different.</p><p>For those of you who are new to playing Stumble Guys, it is recommended that you study each stage first. So you can know where the obstacles are and when the timing is right.</p>"
