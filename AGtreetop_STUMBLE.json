Don't jump on crowded steps</span></em></p><p>Although the last round usually leaves about 8 players surviving, this Lava Land map is not as simple as imagined.</p><p>Given that there are not many footholds that can be stepped on, it will often make many players forced to huddle together on the same footing.</p><p>This is a big risk, because it will make the potential fall higher.</p><p>Therefore, try as much as possible to find a foothold with the least number of players.</p><p>Those are some tips and tricks or tutorials that you can try in order to win the Lava Land map in the Stumble Guys game</p>"
