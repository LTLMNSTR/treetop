Don't Rush</strong></p><p>There are several challenges in Stumble Guys and most of the stages require you to reach the finish line.</p><p>For challenges of this type, it is recommended that you do not rush to complete them. Because if you are in a hurry, later it can make you less thorough in seeing every obstacle that is in the stage.</p><p>Not to mention if you fall, then you have to return to the initial checkpoint.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Playing Timing</strong></p><p>As mentioned earlier, Stumble Guys stages have different obstacles. Well, each of these obstacles usually has its own timing.</p><p>For example, in the stage above, there are obstacles to get past the rotating hammer. In this challenge, it means that you have to pass the hammer without hitting the character you are using.</p><p>The way to get past it is to pay attention to the timing of the rotation of the hammer.

Either by the side of the road or otherwise.</p><p>You can learn this shortcut on Youtube, because each map is usually different. Shortcuts should also be repeated until you get used to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Use Emotes sparingly</strong></p><p>For those who are curious about what an emote is, the emote in Stumble Guys is a feature where we can stop the opponent's movement.</p><p>Emotes can certainly be very helpful. But in the wrong conditions, emotes can actually make us lose.</p><p>Therefore, it is recommended to use the emote only as necessary. And make sure the emote timing is right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Learn Each Stage</strong></p><p>With different stages, the completion of each stage must also be different.</p><p>For those of you who are new to playing Stumble Guys, it is recommended that you study each stage first. So you can know where the obstacles are and when the timing is right.</p>"

      "link": "<h2><strong><em>Stumble Guys Map Guide - The Best Tips and Tricks for Winning Every Round</em></strong></h2><p>Ever since its inception, Fall Guys has been creating shockwaves in the gaming community, with its simple yet very entertaining multiplayer gameplay, and a wide variety of maps to keep the matches fresh on every round. And like with anything that becomes massively popular, similar games inevitably started to pop up, with Stumble Guys being one of the most popular variants.</p><p>Now, while it&rsquo;s easy to dismiss it as a copycat, Stumble Guys actually do its own fair share of things right. For starters, it launched first as a mobile-exclusive title, making it the best Fall Guys-style multiplayer game for smartphones, which says a lot. Secondly, while the gameplay is very reminiscent of the original, Stumble Guys have its own mechanics, as well as its own unique repertoire of maps and obstacle courses. In this regard, you can consider this game as an extension of the original&mdash;whenever you get bored of the maps in Fall Guys, you can switch to Stumble Guys, and vice versa.</p><p>However, while Stumble Guys do have its fair share of optimizations for mobile gamers, such as dynamic thumbsticks for improved controls, the best way to enjoy this multiplayer party game is on PC since you&rsquo;ll have a much easier time lining up precise jumps with your keyboard than with touchscreen controls, not to mention that you&rsquo;ll be playing on a large monitor instead of a cramped phone screen. And in this regard, now.gg is the best online platform to play Stumble Guys on your PC, since it gives you direct access to this game on your browser, with just a single click&mdash;just go to the Stumble Guys app page on now.gg, click on &ldquo;Play in browser&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re ready to go!</p><p>With that being said, this article is meant to be a guide to the game&rsquo;s 20 fun-filled maps. In the following paragraphs, we&rsquo;ll be giving you a rundown of all the game&rsquo;s maps, as well as a few tips and tricks for winning all your matches.</p><p><strong>Over and Under</strong></p><p>Our first entry on this list is, appropriately enough, one of the most basic and straightforward Stumble Guys maps in the current lineup. This is simply an obstacle course where you must reach the goal before other players do. However, true to its name, this map revolves around obstacles that must be avoided either by going over or under them. Specifically, the first section has some rather pesky horizontal bars that constantly move up and down, and you must time your movements and jumps carefully to either run under them or jump over them.</p><p>Over and Under is a map that greatly rewards the player&rsquo;s patience, especially in the midsection where there are vertical bars moving rapidly across rails in a grid formation. And while avoiding individual bars isn&rsquo;t overly complicated, the fact that there are so many of them sliding across the same part of the stage can make it a bit tough to get through this section quickly. Nevertheless, the trick here is to actually be patient and wait until you have a clear path to get through this part in just one straight dash. However, don&rsquo;t be afraid to stop if you have to; you lose much less time waiting until you get an opening than if you crash into a bar and get blown back and knocked to the ground.</p><p>Similarly, on the last part of this map, where the final three platforms slide in and out of the final ascent, patience is also important; wait until the platforms have come out a bit before trying to jump on them. Especially if you&rsquo;re racing side by side against one or more players, jumping too early may cause you to bump into other players in the air and make you miss your jumps entirely, forfeiting your position.</p><p><strong>Icy Heights</strong></p><p>Unlike the previous obstacle course, Icy Heights is a map that shakes things up by adding slippery floors that make it difficult to stop your momentum, change directions, or even to calculate your jumps with precision. And while it&rsquo;s not impossible to stop yourself from sliding off edges, the fact that other hasty players will constantly bump into you means that, more often than not, you&rsquo;ll be falling off the map if you stick around the same spot for too long.</p><p>Winning in Icy Heights is all about striking the right balance between speed and control. This means that instead of reacting to whatever comes your way, you need proper planning and preparation to blaze right through without losing momentum. For example, in the first roundabout that comes shortly after starting the race, you can start running towards either the right or left, so that when you actually get to the bend, you can clear it without crashing into the bumper, and then immediately run to the opposite direction to clear the roundabout and continue running forward. This type of forward-thinking and preparation will let you get through most of the map with ease.</p><p>Two last small tips we can give you in Icy Heights is that, in the part where you&rsquo;re running uphill dodging snowballs, you can actually cut some corners by jumping on the railings instead of actually running around the bends. Moreover, in the last downhill section before the goal, DON&rsquo;T DIVE down the slope. Contrary to what it may seem, sliding down the hill is actually slower than running.</p><p><strong>Jungle Roll</strong></p><p>One of the more interesting obstacle courses currently in the game, particularly since it heavily focuses on making your way across a series of large spinning logs that are riddled with barriers, pitfalls, and other obstacles.</p><p>The stage starts and ends with a few simple platforming and barrier challenges, though the fun only really begins once you reach the aforementioned logs. These tumbling former trees can spin either clockwise or counterclockwise, making walking on them quite challenging since you&rsquo;ll always have to move in the opposite direction so you don&rsquo;t fall off while crossing. Moreover, the logs have a variety of obstacles throughout their lengths, so you might find yourself walking into barriers fairly often.</p><p>The jump dive combo is your best friend on this map since it will let you squeeze by oncoming obstacles without having to wait for the log to spin them out of your way. However, you have to be careful with your jumping and diving since the logs also have a few pitfalls here and there. If you blindly rely on this maneuver for too long, you&rsquo;ll find yourself diving straight through a hole.</p><p><strong>Space Race</strong></p><p>This map would be a regular obstacle course race like some of the others we&rsquo;ve mentioned so far, if not for one main difference: It has very low gravity. This is one of the more unique maps since it actually alters the physics of the game, allowing players to jump higher and farther. As a result, this map has a ton of pitfalls and long jumps that can look much tougher than they really are, a fact that is further compounded by the map&rsquo;s unique aesthetics and &ldquo;space&rdquo; theme.</p><p>This map is quite long and has multiple platforming sections, but if you treat it just like any other platforming challenge, you&rsquo;ll be fine. However, there is a bit of randomization near the end, where players must jump into one of three boost tunnels to land on the final goal platforms. The RNG factor comes from the fact that the goal can be in any of the three final platforms. And since you can&rsquo;t know its current location before jumping into the final boost tunnels, lucky players could actually land closer to the goal than the others.</p><p><strong>Honey Drop</strong></p><p>This one is a survival map, but with a twist: The players are set in a multilevel arena with floor tiles shaped like honeycombs. The twist here is that, whenever a player steps on a tile, it&rsquo;ll turn red and disappear after a second. In this sense, the idea is to always keep moving and avoid falling into the bottom levels as much as possible, as there will be a point when there are no levels remaining, and the players will fall straight into the void, getting instantly eliminated.</p><p>Though you could focus exclusively on surviving, there are some strategies that you can use to improve your odds of winning. For instance, you could preemptively land on a tile that another player is jumping toward, activating its countdown, and possibly making your rivals fall to the lower level prematurely. However, this strategy has its fair share of risks, especially since you might end up falling through instead of your rival.</p><p>Whatever you do, if you&rsquo;re surviving just fine on the top level while all the other players have fallen, it might be a good idea to consider following them down. The reason for this is that, since you can&rsquo;t really move your camera to watch the players that are below you, it&rsquo;s difficult to get a good view of the arena. In this sense, if you DO end up falling, you might just fall through an open hole and straight into the void. To avoid this, you could just jump down while there are plenty of floor tiles left, and simply duke it out with your rivals to try and survive until the end.</p><p><strong>Bombardment</strong></p><p>Like Honey Drop, this one is also a survival map that, thankfully, has no disappearing platforms or anything of the sort. However, there IS a pirate ship in the distance shooting cannonballs at the map, which progressively explode on its platforms and removes them entirely while also sending nearby players flying. As the round progresses, fewer platforms will be left, which is where this map gets its name.</p><p>A good tip here is to try and hog the large metal boxes, which can&rsquo;t be destroyed, though most other players will likely try to do the same. As a result, you could end up getting shoved into the water, or pushed off the platform and into a bomb. Furthermore, the pirate ship tends to fire its bombs towards where most players are located, which makes these permanent tiles extra dangerous.</p><p>With all that being said, we suggest staying away from other players when there are lots of platforms still left, and then try to go for the permanent platforms with the fewest players. Remember that the idea is to survive only until there is a specific number of players left, so matches might actually be very short if other players are quickly eliminated.</p><p><strong>Cannon Climb</strong></p><p>Cannon Climb, true to its name, is all about avoiding cannonballs while making your way to the top of a mountain. It starts with avoiding a few bumpers. However, soon enough, you&rsquo;ll run into this map&rsquo;s namesake, a long uphill climb with several cannons along the way that shoot cannonballs down at the players. These cannonballs bounce and bump against the slope&rsquo;s barrier and obstacles, haphazardly changing direction along the way, which makes them exceedingly difficult to predict.</p><p>The climb is a mix between skill and luck; while the cannons constantly change shot directions, an observant player can quickly identify the trajectory of the rolling cannonballs and adapt accordingly. Just try not to get tunnel vision on your character, and instead keep your eyes on the field at all times so you can react to whatever rolls your way.</p><p><strong>Pivot Push</strong></p><p>Pivot Push starts off innocently enough looking like any other obstacle course, with a few pivoting barriers that players must push out of the way before moving through. This is one of the more skill-focused maps due to not only the final upwards climb, but also due to all the obstacles that come before. </p><p>In particular, the narrow bridge with the hammer pendulums swinging back and forth will be one of the obstacles that will make you lose the most time if you get hit. This is because, instead of falling to your doom and respawning shortly after, the hammers will knock you down into lower side ditches, and you won&rsquo;t be able to climb back up after the fact, forcing you to walk all the way back to the start of the bridge in order to try again.</p><p><strong>Floor Flip</strong></p><p>This map has the potential to be one of the most frustrating in the entire game, particularly due to its massive platforms that can tip when players add their collective weights to them. In this sense, if several players jump on one side of the platform, they can make it tip in one direction, lowering their side while elevating the other. This makes it difficult or outright impossible to progress if the platform sinks low enough towards one of the sides, and players will have to run across to the other so that they can jump forward onto the next obstacle.</p><p>In the midsection, this stage has a few cubes that rotate periodically, potentially throwing anyone on top of them to their doom. Luckily, this section is very short and can be crossed with a couple of good jump dives.</p><p>Once again, the frustration returns in the final third of the stage with another set of tipping platforms, combined with a final platform that must first be tipped to one side to create a ramp so that the players can reach the goal. Depending on the group&rsquo;s actions, this final platform can either be over quite quickly or last for quite a while as players move back and forth trying to tip it in the right direction to get through.</p><p><strong>Lava Rush</strong></p><p>One of the more perilous stages in the game, since most of the obstacles that you&rsquo;ll encounter, CAN and WILL vaporize you, making you lose valuable time waiting to respawn. </p><p>In terms of obstacles, Lava Rush consists mainly of long jumps as well as trying to avoid revolving spiky logs and tumbling fireballs. However, in contrast to other obstacle courses where the oncoming projectiles merely knock you down, they will absolutely melt you in Lava Rush, making you wait until you respawn to continue moving forward. And as if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, this map has a lava flow constantly rising and falling throughout the course, which can either reveal walkways when it&rsquo;s low enough or completely cover them when the tide is high. In some cases, you will even have to wait until the lava goes down before you&rsquo;re able to proceed.</p><p>There are no tricks to clearing this stage effectively, aside from practicing. This is one of those maps where experience is key, as you&rsquo;ll see veteran players clearing it the fastest, and most of the new and intermediate players constantly struggling to keep up. But don&rsquo;t worry too much about falling or getting melted&mdash;odds are that there will be tons of other players having troubles as well.</p><p><strong>Tile Fall</strong></p><p>This is one of the most hated maps in both Fall Guys as well as Stumble Guys but in a good way.</p><p>Tile Fall is quite straightforward; cross the short tile bridge and run to the goal. However, the catch here is that the tiles on the bridge can either be solid or fake, and it&rsquo;s impossible to know what they are until a player lands on them. If it&rsquo;s a solid tile, it will light up green and stay in position, but if it&rsquo;s transparent, it&rsquo;ll briefly turn red before falling, throwing the unlucky players down into the pit.</p><p>There&rsquo;s really no strategy to this and it all comes down to random luck, which is why this map is so infamous. Nevertheless, a tip to stay in the game is to NEVER be in the front of the formation, since players that are behind you will be constantly pushing and forcing you onto the next tiles, effectively turning you into their unwilling guinea pig to scout out the right path. However, by staying in the middle, you&rsquo;ll easily walk on the paths that others have secured, and you&rsquo;ll likely make it to the end as a qualified player.</p><p><strong>Humble Stumble</strong></p><p>True to its name, Humble Stumble is an obstacle course riddled with obstacles meant to not only outright block your path, but also to throw you back and make you lose progress. The way it does this is through the use of boost pads pointing backward, as well as a lot of bumpers that can bounce you in all directions. The final part, in particular, is quite tricky as it consists of jumping across platforms with spinning logs, which not only prompts you to calculate your jump distances correctly, but also forces you to dodge the logs, either by jumping over them or just running from them.</p><p>All in all, this is one of the shorter obstacle courses, which makes it very chaotic as many players often make it to the end with ease.</p><p><strong>Block Dash</strong></p><p>By far one of the hardest survival stages currently in the game, particularly since obstacles can sweep across the stage very quickly, leaving only a single safe spot to pass through. </p><p>Block Dash is a map where all players are placed on a small rectangular platform. From the farthest end of the stage, block formations will sweep across towards the bottom, forcing you to jump over them in order to stay alive. Failure to avoid these formations will leave you helplessly tumbling towards the void, instantly eliminating you from the match.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that while some block formations will let you easily jump over them, some will be taller and with no supporting platforms, and the only way to get past them is by jumping and diving through the darker weaker blocks to break them and pass through. We strongly recommend returning to the center of the stage after getting past a block formation so that you can get a better chance of reacting and moving towards the safe spot on the next formation regardless of its location.</p><p><strong>Paint Splash</strong></p><p>A rather straightforward and simple obstacle course. It gets its name from the paint roller obstacles present in two parts, with the first rolling across from side to side at the beginning, and the second rolling forward to back. Between these paint roller obstacles are a few spinning platforms with a large red button with an &ldquo;X&rdquo; in the middle. Players will have to make their way across the platforms while avoiding the center X, which juts upwards periodically and sends anyone on top to their dooms.</p><p>The paint roller obstacles are quite simple; if they touch you, they knock you down and send you flying. Simply avoid the rollers and take your time with the spinning platforms, and you&rsquo;ll get to the finish in no time. This map is similar to Humble Stumble, in that it&rsquo;s quite easy.</p><p><strong>Lost Temple</strong></p><p>A perilous obstacle course with deadly swinging blades, rolling logs, spiky spears, and massive falling boulders. This map might be a homage to those old Indiana Jones movies and the many dangers that Indy faced during his archeological adventures.</p><p>Avoiding the swinging pendulums at the beginning is quite simple, but the chaos starts as soon as you get to the spear trap section. This part has two branching paths: the left side is a bit shorter but is also much narrower and has many spear traps that you&rsquo;ll need to avoid to get through. Meanwhile, the right path is longer but has only a few spear traps. Choose the path that you think is the best for you depending on your personal skills.</p><p>Next up is another set of two paths, but these ones run parallel to each other, with no major differences. However, while you&rsquo;re making your way up these narrow bridges, large rolling logs will be constantly descending down you, with the only way to avoid them being by jumping over them. Since you&rsquo;re going uphill during this part, you will need to time your jumps extra carefully, as you won&rsquo;t jump as high as normal.</p><p>After the logs comes another bridge, this time with fist pillars jutting out rhythmically from both sides. Patience is key here: Wait until the fists jut out and start retracting before trying to cross. Skilled players can use jump dives to get past two pillars at a time, but there&rsquo;s always the risk of getting hit and knocked down, throwing you back to the beginning of this section and making you waste valuable seconds.</p><p>Last but not least, the final stretch of the temple consists of a climb through a semicircular slope. However, there&rsquo;s a catch: Every few seconds, a huge boulder that covers the entire slope will roll down, knocking away anything that stands in its way. To avoid it, there are a couple of safe spots along the middle of the slope on either side. The idea is to run across to the first safe spots, wait until the boulder passes, and then run all the way to the goal before the next boulder starts rolling down.</p><p>If you survived all that, congratulations, you&rsquo;ve cleared the Lost Temple!</p><p><strong>Spin Go-Round</strong></p><p>A rather short obstacle course consisting mostly of spinning hazards and platforms. Like all the others we&rsquo;ve mentioned so far, the idea is to reach the goal before other players can do so. However, one of the main differences here is that timing is more important than usual, particularly since one wrong move can lead you to getting a faceful of rubber logs or hammers and send you flying back or down to the void. </p><p>This map has a combination of moving floors with spinning obstacles, which further complicates moving through it carefully since, even if you&rsquo;re not moving and waiting for the right moment, you&rsquo;ll also be struggling against the floor tiles shifting you around in all directions. Nevertheless, the most difficult part about this stage is the beginning, since the rubber hammers can make you waste tons of time. Meanwhile, the middle and final sections consist of jumping past spinning logs and moving floating platforms, which carries its own set of difficulty, but often boils down to taking your time and lining up your jumps correctly.</p><p>This map can be summed up with the phrase &ldquo;take your time in a hurry&rdquo;. As long as you plan your jumps carefully, you&rsquo;ll make it&mdash;always remember that it&rsquo;s better to spend some time lining up your jumps than it is to fall down and having to wait until you respawn.</p><p><strong>Super Slide</strong></p><p>A fun and adrenaline-fueled obstacle course where the objective, as always, is to reach the goal before anyone else. The main difference in Super Slide is that, as its name implies, you&rsquo;re basically stuck careening down a long water slide, and there&rsquo;s no way to actually stop and line up your jumps correctly. In this sense, your timing is crucial for properly dodging obstacles and getting through the map faster than anyone else.</p><p>Though there are really no magical tips for this one other than &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bump into stuff and try not to fall down&rdquo;, you can actually save some time during the last stretch of the water slide by jumping out of the slides when bending through corners, and landing on the next part of the slide. If done correctly, you will have jumped over some obstacles, and will actually have saved some time by taking these impromptu shortcuts. However, this trick takes some practice, so don&rsquo;t expect to survive the first few rounds when trying to pull this off.</p><p><strong>Laser Tracer</strong></p><p>This one could be one of the toughest individual challenges, alongside Block Dash, in the entire game, particularly since it&rsquo;s very punishing and you are instantly eliminated if you get even slightly touched by the lasers.</p><p>In Laser Tracers, all players are thrown into a circular arena and are then set upon by lasers that move across the field in sweeping patterns. Players who are touched by the lasers are instantly vaporized and, as you can imagine, eliminated from the round. And while the lasers themselves are not very difficult to avoid, other players will constantly bump and jump into you, possibly throwing you off into an early demise.</p><p>The same principle that applies to other individual survival challenges is valid in Laser Tracer. That is, try to find your own solitary corner and focus mainly on dodging lasers. If other players get close to you, simply reposition and try to find another isolated spot. In this sense, while other players are bumping and jumping into each other, you can easily dodge lasers and try to survive for as long as possible. </p><p>It goes without saying that proper jump timing is of the utmost importance in this map, since it only takes one false move to get yourself eliminated.</p><p><strong>Capture the Flag</strong></p><p>Our final entry on this list is one of the most challenging maps in Stumble Guys, particularly since it&rsquo;s the current team-based map in the game. </p><p>In Capture the Flag, the players are divided into two teams, Blue and Yellow. The map itself consists of an arena with several flag posts, narrow hallways, and bounce pads. The objective is to run to the flag posts to capture them, and then try to prevent the enemy from taking them from you. In this manner, the longer you hold onto your flags, the more points you&rsquo;ll score. And once the timer expires, the team with the most points will move onto the next round.</p><p>Now, there are a few things to consider here, particularly if you&rsquo;re looking to maximize your chances of winning. For starters, there is no jumping or sliding on this map. Instead, your jump button is replaced by a missile icon, which fires the bazooka that your character carries over his shoulder. These missiles blow up in a wide area and send all the players caught in the blast flying in all directions. This weapon is your main method of capturing and defending your flags. Moreover, while you can&rsquo;t really jump nor get out of the way, the best way to move around between flag posts is by using the bounce pads strewn throughout the arena.</p><p>The only bad thing about Capture the Flag is that, since it&rsquo;s a team challenge, there&rsquo;s really nothing you can do on your own, except try to capture and maintain a few points. Regardless, it comes down to your team to organize and help to capture other flags in order to maximize your score.</p><p><strong>Stumble Soccer</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s soccer! Do we have to elaborate any further? You bump into the ball to try and shoot it into the enemy goal. The team with the most goals when the timer expires will be declared the winner, with the losers being eliminated from the current match.</p><p>No but seriously, this one suffers from the same shortcomings as Capture the Flag; even if you&rsquo;re the best player on the planet, you&rsquo;ll still have to rely on your teammates to pull their own weight. This makes Stumble Soccer one of the least favorite maps for everyone.</p><p>While some of these challenges are obviously tougher than others, we can&rsquo;t stress enough the importance of having good controls when it comes to not only surviving and making it through the many maps in Stumble Guys, but actually winning your matches. For this reason, we suggest always playing Stumble Guys on the mobile cloud with now.gg. All it takes is a single click, and you&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy this game with the best controls, graphics, and performance, regardless of your computer or device.</p>"
